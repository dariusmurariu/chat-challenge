                <li>I used Vue.js v3.0</li>
                <li>Tailwind CSS was a big ally for the responsive design and the efficiency. ðŸ™‚</li>
                <li>Instead of making a mess with child/parent communication by using emits, I used <strong>Vuex</strong> in order to centralize everything.</li>
                <li>For the Chatbot animations I used the transition component.</li>
                <li>The messages from the chatbot must be different from the user ones, positioning them right and left its the easiest way to fullfill this one ðŸ˜‰. [Check âœ…]</li>
                <li>The image and the name of the chatbot must appear so that the user knows at all times who they are talking to. [Check âœ…] </li>
                <li>The chat window must have a drop-down menu to select options such as forgetting user data, changing the language or accessing the privacy policy. [Check âœ…] <i>Functionality added only to "Forget Data/Olvidar mis datos"</i> </li>
                <li>I have implemented Chat Buttons as well in order to not only send text messages. You can find them at the bottom of the message container.</li>
                <li>Pre chatbot call to action display. [Added âœ…]</li>
